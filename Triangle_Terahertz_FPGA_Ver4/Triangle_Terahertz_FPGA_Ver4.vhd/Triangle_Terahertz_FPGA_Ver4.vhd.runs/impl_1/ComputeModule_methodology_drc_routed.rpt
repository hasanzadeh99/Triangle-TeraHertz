2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
TIMING-6#1 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out_clk_wiz_0 and clk_out_clk_wiz_0_1 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out_clk_wiz_0] -to [get_clocks clk_out_clk_wiz_0_1]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-6#2 Critical Warning
No common primary clock between related clocks  
The clocks clk_out_clk_wiz_0_1 and clk_out_clk_wiz_0 are related (timed together) but they have no common primary clock. The design could fail in hardware. To find a timing path between these clocks, run the following command: report_timing -from [get_clocks clk_out_clk_wiz_0_1] -to [get_clocks clk_out_clk_wiz_0]
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -197.712 ns between divider_ip_instance/U0/i_synth/i_has_input_skid.i_2to1/gen_has_z_tready.reg2_b_tdata_reg[6]/C (clocked by clk_out_clk_wiz_0) and dout_tdata_reg[12]/D (clocked by clk_out_clk_wiz_0_1).
